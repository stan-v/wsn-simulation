# Wireless Sensor Network Simulation
Models a network of nodes (sensors) communicating via LoRa and BLE. 

The project aimed to give more insight in the working, range, and power consumption of a network of sensors that communicate using a certain wireless communication technology. Several parameters can be tweaked for the simulation and subsequently the result will be visualized.

### Requirements
This project requires `matplotlib` and `numpy`. 

### How to run
```python
python network.py
```
